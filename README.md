# Overview

Ninja is a portable remote computer control software. Once it's ran on a remote computer, it will provide you shell access, file transfer (upload/download) and shell stream. 
There's no need to open ports on the remote computer, even if it uses a cellular data network and is behind proxies, there will be no problem in connection since Ninja wont listen on a port for conenctions and instead will ask the controller or the __[Jonin][jonin]__ computer for connection (WebSocket if available, otherwise xhr polling). So the controller computer should be running __[Jonin][jonin]__ and have the required port open.

# [Jonin][jonin]
Jonin is the pair for Ninja which can control (order!) multiple __Ninja__ instances. You'll need to use it on the controller computer in order to communicate with a Ninja

# Setup & Usage

To setup Ninja, you only need to: 

- Downlaod the __[release][release]__ and extract it 
- Change __HOST__ and __PORT__ in `config/constants.json` to match values on __[Jonin][jonin]__. Please read [This Guidance][host-setup] about how to setup HOST to never lose access to Ninja
- You're all set. Happy spying!


__You can check __[Jonin][jonin]__ (the controller of Ninja) for details on how to control Ninja and list of commands__



# Configuration File
You can find this file in `config/constants.json`:

```jsonc
{
	// connection port
    "PORTS": {
        "DATA": 3704
    },

    // name to identify Ninja on Jonin when working with multiple Ninjas
    "NAME": "Ninja Name",

    // Jonin computer's address
    "HOST": "domain.com", 

    // connection config. any valid Socket.io option
    "CONNECTION": {
        "RECONNECTION_DELAY_MAX": 5000,
        "RECONNECTION_DELAY": 1000,
        "TIMEOUT": 20000,

        "rejectUnauthorized": false
    },

    // interval in which file receiver party will send ack to sender
    "FILE_TRANSFER": {
        "ACK_INTERVAL": 2000
    },

    // stop logging, this SHOULD BE true when using as a sevice to prevent 
    // logs file growing forever 
    "NO_LOG": false,

    "PROGRESS_BAR": {
    	// progress bar colors 
        "COLOR_MAP": {
            "FAILED": ["red", "red"],
            "INVALID": ["red", "red"],
            "DONE": ["gray", "green"],
            "IN_PROGRESS": ["gray", "cyan"]
        },
        // progress bar name/label maximum length
        "MAX_NAME_LENGTH": 10
    }
}

```

# Host Setup
When configuring __[Ninja][ninja]__, you should use a __HOST__ that will always be available. So you'll have to use one of the following options:

### Use Dynamic DNS
This is the best way I can suggest since It's free and easy. you just need to create an account in one of DDNS services (like [Duck DNS][duckdns] and [No-Ip][noip]), create a domain name and set it to point to your dynamic IP address. If your ISP changed your IP, then just simply change it on DDNS website or install a Dynamic Update Client (DUC) to do this for you automatically.

### Use A Static IP Address
You can use an IP address for your Jonin and set this IP in __[Ninja][ninja]__'s configuration. This is not recommended since you'll have to spend money while there are easy free ways, unless you have a static IP already

### Use A Domain Name
Just like static IP, you can use a domain name for your Jonin and set this name in __[Ninja][ninja]__'s configuration. For same reason as static IP, this also is not a recommended way

# Use As Spyware
Be aware Ninja can be easily used as a spyware when installed as a service, it will open full access to the target computer for the __[Jonin][jonin]__ controlling it

# Install Using Servicifier
Using __[Servicifier][servicifier]__, You can install Ninja as a service on Windows only with a single click. To do so: 
- download __[Servicifier][servicifier]__ and extract 
- download Ninja and extract it in `Servicifier/files`
- create [Servicifier installation config file][servicifier-install-config]
- run Servicifier __as adminstrator__ and you're done
